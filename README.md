Project Overview :

We have designed and developed an ecosystem which can schedule donation depending on the need like food/shelter. We have created a Non-governmental Organization(NGO) system that lists company and schedules venues for the donation to take place.

Any company can be willing to donate items - food etc. The NGO can accept company requests and manages donation by generating schedule.

The location is then set according to the generated schedule. Venue manager accepts the donation. From here on - other third parties like supplier, sponsor & volunteers can give their share of donation. Some work requests include - Supplier posts the stocks that he can supply for the donation, logistics department post travel and cargo that they can share, sponsors give money that can be used ,volunteers come forward to help with donation.

Company manager accepts all of this & finally the donation takes place successfully. Analytics team can visualize under a particular location which company has contributed the most.

Here are the 4 different enterprises - NGO Unit, Company Management Unit, Service Unit, Donation Unit

The organizations include - Company Org, NGO Management Org, Donation Scheduling Dept, Volunteer Request Dept, Equipment request Dept, Supplier Managing Dept, Sponsor Delegating Dept, Venue Management Dept, Food sponsor Dept, Equipment Supplier Dept, Stock Managing Dept

Each organization has a specific role and work request that goes on between them.
